The python notebook attached in this repository solves the question 1 given as a screening test by Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF).

The first file does not work for some cases while the file titled 'Final_BitStringComparator' works for all cases.

The problem statement is mentioned in both the notebooks which is to input a list and a number and return numbers in the list which are less than given number.

The first file tries implementing a quantum bit string comparator whose source was the research paper: Oliveira, David & Ramos, Rubens. (2007). Quantum bit string comparator: Circuits and applications. Quantum Computers and Computing. 7, however I faced problems while executing the circuit and got logical errors.

The second file ('Final_BitStringComparator') works for all cases.
